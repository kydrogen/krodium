# Phase 1: Learn and Understand

## Understanding the basics of an LLM

### What is an LLM?
A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate human-like text. Think of it as a virtual brain that processes language. To make it relatable, imagine the brain's neurons and connections:
- **Neuron**: A single processing unit, like a tiny decision-maker.
- **Dendrites**: The connections that bring information to the neuron.
- **Cortex**: The outer layer of the brain where complex thinking happens.

An LLM has millions (or billions) of these "neurons" in the form of mathematical operations, working together to understand and generate text.

### How does prompting work?
Prompting is like giving instructions to the LLM. There are two main types of prompts:
- **System Prompt**: Sets the rules or context for the conversation (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant.").
- **User Message**: The actual question or input from the user.

By carefully crafting prompts, you can guide the LLM to behave in a specific way or adopt a "personality."

### Building a chatbot with personality
To create a chatbot with personality, you:
1. Define the chatbot's traits (e.g., friendly, humorous, or formal).
2. Use system prompts to set the tone.
3. Fine-tune the model with examples of the desired behavior.

### Examples of popular LLMs
- **GPT**: Known for its versatility and conversational abilities.
- **Claude**: Focuses on ethical and safe AI interactions.
- **Llama**: Lightweight and efficient for specific tasks.

### Analogy for LLMs
Imagine an LLM as a giant library. Each book represents a piece of knowledge. When you ask a question, the LLM quickly "reads" the relevant books and writes a response based on what it learned.

## Understand LangChain and LLMs

### What is LangChain?
LangChain is a framework that helps you build applications using LLMs. It allows you to chain together multiple prompts and responses to create more complex interactions.

### Hosting and using an LLM locally
To host an LLM locally:
1. Install the model on your computer.
2. Use a library like Hugging Face Transformers to load the model.
3. Run the model and interact with it through code.

### Example of LangChain
Here’s a simple example:
```python
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain

# Define a prompt template
prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["name"], template="Hello {name}, how can I help you?")

# Create a chain
chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=your_llm)

# Run the chain
response = chain.run(name="Alex")
print(response)
```
This creates a chatbot that greets users by name.

## Understand the purpose of a server and client in a web application

### Server vs. Client
- **Server**: Like a restaurant kitchen, it prepares and serves data. For example, when you order a pizza, the kitchen (server) makes the pizza and hands it to the waiter.
- **Client**: Like a waiter, it takes user requests (e.g., "I want a pizza") and delivers responses (e.g., "Here’s your pizza") back to the user.

### Data Flow
1. The client sends a request (e.g., "What’s the weather?").
2. The server processes the request and sends back a response (e.g., "It’s sunny and 75°F.").
3. The client displays the response to the user.

### Examples
- **Server-side tasks**: Storing data, running calculations, fetching information from a database.
- **Client-side tasks**: Displaying data, handling user input, creating interactive elements.

### How this ties in with FastAPI and APIRouter
FastAPI acts as the "kitchen" (server) that prepares and serves data. The APIRouter is like the "menu" that organizes different types of requests (e.g., appetizers, main courses, desserts).

#### Example:
Imagine you’re building a chatbot application. Here’s how the server and client analogy works:
- **Client**: A user opens the chatbot interface in their browser and types a question.
- **Server**: FastAPI receives the question, processes it (e.g., sends it to the LLM for a response), and sends the answer back to the client.
- **APIRouter**: Organizes the different endpoints. For example:
  - `/chat`: Handles chatbot interactions.
  - `/status`: Provides the server status.

#### Code Example:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, APIRouter

app = FastAPI()

# Create a router for chatbot-related endpoints
chat_router = APIRouter()

@chat_router.get("/chat")
async def chat(message: str):
    # Simulate processing the message
    response = f"You said: {message}"
    return {"response": response}

# Create a router for status-related endpoints
status_router = APIRouter()

@status_router.get("/status")
async def status():
    return {"status": "Server is running"}

# Include the routers in the FastAPI app
app.include_router(chat_router, prefix="/api")
app.include_router(status_router, prefix="/api")
```
In this example:
- The **client** sends a request to `/api/chat?message=Hello`.
- The **server** processes the request and responds with `{"response": "You said: Hello"}`.
- The **APIRouter** organizes the `/chat` and `/status` endpoints under the `/api` prefix.

## Understand how FastAPI and APIRouting works

### What is FastAPI?
FastAPI is a Python framework for building APIs. It’s fast, easy to use, and supports modern features like asynchronous programming.

### API Routing
Routing determines how requests are handled. For example:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/hello")
async def say_hello():
    return {"message": "Hello, World!"}
```
This creates an endpoint `/hello` that returns a greeting.

### Diagram of Request Flow
1. **Client**: Sends a request to `/hello`.
2. **FastAPI**: Matches the request to the `/hello` route.
3. **Response**: Returns the message "Hello, World!"

### Example Code
Here’s a basic FastAPI app:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/greet")
async def greet(name: str):
    return {"message": f"Hello, {name}!"}
```
This endpoint greets users by name (e.g., `/greet?name=Alex`).

### Why is a server needed in the chatbot application?

While it might seem possible to handle everything on the client side, there are several reasons why a server is essential in a chatbot application:

1. **Processing Power**: Hosting a large language model (LLM) requires significant computational resources. Most client devices, like phones or browsers, lack the processing power to run an LLM efficiently.
2. **Data Security**: A server ensures that sensitive data, such as user inputs, can be processed securely without exposing the model or data to the client.
3. **Centralized Updates**: With a server, updates to the chatbot’s logic or model can be made centrally, ensuring all users benefit from improvements without requiring client-side changes.
4. **Resource Sharing**: A server allows multiple clients to share the same LLM instance, reducing redundancy and optimizing resource usage.

#### Example:
Imagine a chatbot application where the user asks, "What’s the capital of France?"

- **Client-Side Only Approach**: The client would need to download the entire LLM model (which could be several gigabytes) and run it locally. This would:
  - Require a high-performance device.
  - Consume significant bandwidth and storage.
  - Make updates cumbersome, as every client would need to download the updated model.

- **Server-Side Approach**: The client sends the question to the server. The server processes the question using the LLM and sends back the response ("The capital of France is Paris"). This approach:
  - Keeps the client lightweight and fast.
  - Centralizes the heavy lifting on the server.
  - Ensures that updates to the model are instantly available to all clients.

By using a server, the chatbot application can provide a seamless experience to users, regardless of their device’s capabilities.
